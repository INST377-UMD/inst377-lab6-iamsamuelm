# Leaflet Map with Randomly Generated Coordinates:
A simple webpage that uses the Leaflet.js library to display a map of the US and generates three random sets of coordinates. It also makes an API call to get the locality of each coordinate and displays it on the page. Below each marker, the latitude, longitude, and locality of the coordinate are displayed.

# Set Up:
To run, open lab6_muma.html file in a web browser.

# Credits:
The Leaflet.js library is used to display the map on the webpage.
The BigDataCloud API is used to get the locality of each coordinate.
